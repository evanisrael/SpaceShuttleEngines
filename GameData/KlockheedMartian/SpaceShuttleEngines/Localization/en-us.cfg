		// Parts
			#SSE-engine-0-titl = FSX0 Micro Shuttle Engine
			#SSE-engine-0-desc = Initially a toy model shuttle engine, this engine became successful as a leaf blower. Nice for engine clusters.

			#SSE-engine-0-oms-titl = FSX0 Micro Shuttle Engine
			#SSE-engine-0-oms-desc = Initially a toy model shuttle engine, this engine became successful as a leaf blower. Nice for engine clusters.

			#SSE-engine-1-a // km_ssme_rs25s-titl = RX-25s Shuttle Main Engine
			#SSE-engine-1-a // km_ssme_rs25s-desc = Looks like the real thang!

			#SSE-engine-2 // se2-titl = FSX2 Shuttle Engine
			#SSE-engine-2 // se2-desc = A truck bumped into the engine. Now its bent. It is only good for shuttles with external fuel tanks now. It won't be good for orbital maneuvers without fuel tank. Use the OMS in addition. Warning! Can become quite hot.
