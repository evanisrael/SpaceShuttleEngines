---

## Version 1.4.0.0-release

### sarbian

* Removed old changelog from before V1.0
* Straight SSME, better FX, better KM_Gimbal, better performance
* Added straight X25 SSME engine for normal lifters
* FX overhaul. Less blue, fixed smoke.
* Improved KM Gimbal, fixed a bug that occured when the COM moved past the engine
* KM Gimbal now uses .Net 3.5
* KM Gimbal now allows for Yaw trimming, too
* KM Gimbal now supports multi mode engines
* Improved CPU performance by further reducing the collision meshes
* Added multi adapter part for creating engine clusters below tanks

---

## Version 0.9.2.0-release

* Updated Smart Parts
* Heading control over radio
* Improved altimeter device (thanks to Firov)
* Bugfix in the timer code
* Corrected size descriptions of fuel breakers and tanks
* Fixed bug with engine tweakables that made the CoM disappear
* Increased the weight of the OMS engines to match the TWR of the LV-909
* Reduced the heat production of the X3 engine
* Updated Firefly example craft (was broken)

---

## Version 0.9.1.0-release

* New Smart Parts Version (Caution! Compatibility notice below!)
* Complete overhaul of the smart parts
* New remote controller part (control other vessel's action groups over radio)
* Altimeter action group trigger
* Updated example craft
* Trim can now be toggled

---

## Version 0.9.0.0-release

* Tweakables, new gimbal logic and linear aerospike
* Added a completely new gimbal logic:
  * Proper roll support (can be activated on demand)
  * Proper part-based x and y limitations (even when the part is rotated)
  * Tweakables: tweak gimballing speed and trim the 0 position (it does not change the gimbal range)
* Added tweakables to timer (now you can set the duration with a slider)
* Added linear aerospike with mechanic gimballing
* Added Atlantis C craft as demonstration for the aerospike
* Updated the other example craft

---

## Version 0.8.2.0-release

* 0.23 Compatibility
* Reverted to normal gimbal logic. It does not feel and look like the previous logic but it works.
* Adjusted attachment node positions. Squad has finally fixed the attachment node vectors.

* Removed redundancy to exsurgent engineer .dll (it is not used any more)

---

## Version 0.8.1.0-release

* Maintenace update
* Corrected spelling mistake in countdown counter
* Corrected wrong Isp setting for x3 engine
* Corrected wrong size of flameout detectors
* Improved visual appearance of flameout detectors
* Corrected heat animation of OMS engine
* Updated Falcon example craft

---

## Version 0.8.0.0-release

* Performance improvements and new automatic parts
* Reduced the size of the textures to save a total of 200MB RAM
* Replaced any colliders with box colliders - easier to compute, lighter on the CPU
* Removed an unnecessary collider from the BB1 engine. It should perform better now.
* Added fuel controller. It can turn on and off the fuel crossfeed. It is used with fuel lines.
* Added fuel controller functionality to in-line fuel breaker. They can now control the fuel flow, too
* Moved in-line fuel breakers tu Utility section in the editor
* Added timer device. It can even trigger actions on separated stages! Control it with action groups.
* Added Flameout detector. This should make building spaceplanes with more than one jet engine easier.
* Added an example vessel Falcon to show the new functions.

---

## Version 0.7.0.0-release

* Automatic staging and action groups plus minor fixes
* Added staging and action group trigger thingies (see pictures)
* Removed surface attachment property from fuel breakers
* Adjusted drag values for fuel tanks and caps a bit until I found out that all values of the stock parts are bogus. If someone wants to make a sane suggestion - go ahead.

---

## Version 0.6.0.0-release

* BB2 Non-rotating Big Bang Engine
* Added non-rotating BB engine. Maybe this solves the lag problem.

---

## Version 0.5.0.0-release
